The code in this directory makes use of vector instructions added with z13.
These vector instructions are well-designed and naturally much more modern than
the legacy of S/390 instructions.  From GMP's perspective, the full set of
128-bit addition and subtraction, with register-based carry in and out, are
very useful.  Unfortunately, the multiply support is unexpectedly limited,
forcing GMP to use the the legacy mlg/mlgr instructions, juggling results
between plain and vector registers.
