This directory contains preliminary assembly code for nails-enabled
21264.  The code is not very well optimized.

1. The *mul_* functions use too many registers.  Several temps could be
   combined.
2. The *mul_1 functions load from up and rp very early.  The code could be
   considerably simplified with later loads.
3. The addmul_1 and submul_1 functions run 1.25 cycles/limb slower than
   possible with better U0/U1/L0/L1 scheduling.

		current		fair		best
Routine		c/l  i/c	c/l  i/c	c/l  i/c
mul_1		3.5		2.75		2.75 3.273
addmul_1	4.5		3.5		3.25 3.385
addmul_2	4.0		2.5		2.25 3.333
addmul_3	3.0		2.25		2    3.333
addmul_4	2.5		2		2    3.135

(The "best" column doesn't account for bookkeeping instructions and
thereby assumes infinite unrolling.)
