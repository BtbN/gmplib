C Sometimes speed degenerates to 2.58 c/l, supposedly related to that some
C operand alignments cause conflicts in the blocked cache.

C The speed is limited by decoding/issue bandwith.  There are 29 instructions
C in the loop, which corresponds to 29/3/4 = 2.417 c/l.  Better speed could be
C achieved by using indexed addressing (and thereby saving pointer updates) and
C by using more unrolling.  Since we save and restore carry using two registers
C (ebp and eax), carry is irrelevant between these instructions, and that could
C be used for loop counter update using addq, as required for proper indexed
C addressing.

C It should be possible to get a little under 2 c/l for this operation, to
C about 46/8/3 = 1.917 c/l.

C FIXME: Use technique of rsh1add_n.asm to handle unrolling.  That will save
C a register (rbx) and allow for a noticable constant speedup.
