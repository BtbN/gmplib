RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES

The code in the top-level works best with i386, i486, members of the P6
family (i.e., Pentium Pro, II, III), and the Amd Athlon/K7.

The `pentium' subdirectory contains code optimized for Pentium.  In most
cases, this is the best choice for Amd K6 too, with the exception of
add/sub.

The `k6' subdirectory contains code optimized for the K6.

STATUS

The code is well-optimized for Intel chips, but not so well-optimized for
Amd and Cyrix chips.

For implementations with slow double shift instructions (SHLD and SHRD), it
might be better to mimic their operation with SHL+SHR+OR.  (K6 and M2 are
likely to benefit from that, but not Pentium due to its slow plain SHL and
SHR.)
