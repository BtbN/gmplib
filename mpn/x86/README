STATUS

The code is well-optimized for AMD and Intel chips, but not so well
optimized for Cyrix chips.


RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES

For implementations with slow double shift instructions (SHLD and
SHRD), it might be better to mimic their operation with SHL+SHR+OR.
(M2 is likely to benefit from that, but not Pentium due to its slow
plain SHL and SHR.)

We should use MMX instructions for copying and perhaps shifts.  For
shifts, significant performance boosts on the K6 and K7 have been
obtained.  Operands need to be aligned for full speed, especially on
Intel chips, but that can easily be achieved by using the full range
of shift counts, 1 to 63.

           current shift speed     mmx shift speed
    P55             5.4                 4.0
    P6              2.5                 2.0
