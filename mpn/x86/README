RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES

The code in the top-level works best with i386, i486, and members of the P6
family (i.e., Pentium Pro, II, III).

The `pentium' subdirectory contains code optimized for Pentium.  In most
cases, this is the best choice for Amd K6 too, with the exception of
add/sub.

For Cyrix M2 the situation is more complex:

		shift	add_n	mul_1	addmul_1
generic x86	9	2.4	16	14.8
pentium		6.5	2.4	15	16

The odd addmul_1 timing can probably be explained by that the generic x86
version is 4-way unrolled.

STATUS

The code is well-optimized for Intel chips, but not so well-optimized for
Amd and Cyrix chips, since they have not published timing information.

For implementations with slow double shift instructions (SHLD and SHRD), it
might be better to mimic their operation with SHL+SHR+OR.  (K6 and M2 are
likely to benefit from that, but not Pentium due to its slow plain SHL and
SHR.)
