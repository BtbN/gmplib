This directory contains mpn functions for various x86 chips.

CODE ORGANIZATION

The code in the top-level works best with i386, i486, members of the P6
family (i.e., Pentium Pro, II, III), and the Amd Athlon/K7.

The `pentium' subdirectory contains code optimized for Pentium.  In most
cases, this is the best choice for Amd K6 too, with the exception of
add/sub.

The `k6' subdirectory contains code optimized for the K6.

STATUS

The code is well-optimized for Intel chips, but not so well-optimized for
Amd and Cyrix chips.

For implementations with slow double shift instructions (SHLD and SHRD), it
might be better to mimic their operation with SHL+SHR+OR.  (K6 and M2 are
likely to benefit from that, but not Pentium due to its slow plain SHL and
SHR.)

RELEVANT OPTIMIZATION ISSUES

We should use MMX instructions for copying and perhaps shifts.  For shifts,
we can get a very significant performance boost on the K6 and K7, but we
need to make sure operands are aligned for full speed, but that can easily
be achieved by using the full range of shift counts, 1 to 63.
